        MLB Player HR Predictor is a web application that predicts the number of home runs a Major League Baseball player will hit in a season.

        The application uses a machine learning model trained on data from the 2022 MLB seasons. The model takes a player's statistics from the previous season as input and outputs the predicted number of home runs for the upcoming season.

        This application has two main features:

        1. **Predict HRs**: Enter a player's statistics from the previous season to get the predicted number of home runs for the upcoming season.

        2. **Player Comparison**: Compare the predicted number of home runs for two players based on their statistics from the previous season.
